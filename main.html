		 When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, 
         Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability 
         to fight injustice. With brilliant performances, gripping action, and a story that 
         redefines the superhero genre, <em>The Dark Knight</em> remains one of the greatest 
         films of the 21st century.
